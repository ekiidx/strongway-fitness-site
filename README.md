Strong Way is a gym by women, for women located near Columbus, Ohio. Strong Way originally started as a way for women to meet up digitally during the recent pandemic.

## Goals
- Brand a new company in a style that is for women.
- Create a scheduling system.
- Create WordPress CMS so the client could update information themselves.

The client needed a way to schedule and promote classes in a variety of different times, and in different categories. I decided to build them an interactive menu that would allow for easy updating. The client also requested a re-brand of the company including the logo. The website was built in collaboration using Figma as a project management tool.

This template uses [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a UI framework.
